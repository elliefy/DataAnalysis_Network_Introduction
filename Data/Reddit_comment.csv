No.  The firearm community actively commends disobedience to those laws *we* consider unjust, all the newly minted felons in CT are heroes of the fight!  This is the same community that spouts molon labe at the first thought of *their* guns being taken away.

Instead of seeking allies in those who champion amendments other than the 2nd and banding together, we are just creating more infighting and bickering that serves no one.  Except of course the government that believes all men are to be fleeced equally.

Having lived/ing in two of the strictest gun control states in the U.S, though, the anti-gun lobby is not going to limit its scope of materials regardless of where its coming from, anonymity be damned. 

It might seem a moot point, which I can understand. But I don't think anything is necessarily lost in the long run, and even a tiny gain in public image is a valuable one. Every little bit counts, and the more the community works to retain a strong positive public image, the better.

The internet might be global, and /r/guns might be small in the larger scope of things, but a lot of small communities can make a big difference - frankly I think small communities do a better job of projecting a positive image of gun ownership than the NRA does, but thats a personal opinion. 

As a side note on PII, you'd be surprised how much people let go of on social media. Even you have a decent chunk of PII through your submission history, and at least one event that would make for pretty easy media fodder. People tend to think that 'anonymity' persists as time goes on - I believe this is only possible if you strictly police your postings, which I think many users may not.

They are still and should still be afforded all the rights that were granted to them by their creator.  As for massive undiagnosed or untreated mentally unstable people, it seems to me its the drugs we give them that do more to inspire people to go on shooting sprees than the mental condition they may or may not suffer from. 
 
&gt; And yes, rights can be taken away. That's what jail is. It's temporary, but you sure as shit don't have your rights intact in jail.

.  Serve your time and you should (in an ideal world) get them back.  Regardless of what crime has been committed or where a person is, the right to self defense can never actually be taken away.  it can be violated, but never actually taken away.

&gt; Huehue. My point is that some people SHOULD have a problem getting one. 

Good luck with that.

&gt; You are too busy jerking off to the Constitution to understand the fact that there are some people we do not want having guns. 

You can not want certain people to have guns all you want.  Doesn't change the fact that they can and do get them.  If more people jerked off to the Constitution, maybe this would be a better country.

&gt; It doesn't have to be black and white, we can make exceptions.

No, you really can't. 

&gt; That's the purpose of the Supreme Court. For a Constituationalist, you sure don't know much about balance of powers. The courts interpret the letter of the law regardless of whether the text changes. It was designed to function that way. 

So ""Shall not be infringed"" is interpreted as ""Can be infringed when we say so"".  So sad that the logical fallacy inherent sails directly over your head.  The courts can interpret the letter of the law as they wish, there are many examples where the courts have had it wrong.  The Constitution is written such that a high schooler can understand it.  It's only people who make a living twisting words and splitting hairs that sow confusion in lesser minds.  I personally don't subvert my intelligence to anybody wearing a black robe.

&gt; Typical redditor, doesn't understand that insulting someone is not an ad hominem fallacy.

You haven't insulted me at all.  You may be trying, but the opinion of worthless people is in general, worthless.
Abusive ad hominem usually involves attacking the traits of an opponent as a means to invalidate their arguments.   Calling me dumb and trying to disparage my intelligence as a means to try to invalidate my argument while not addressing my arguement is ad hominem.  Look it up.

&gt; As for my level of intelligence, I'm not really concerned in that department.

That makes two of us.

&gt;  It's funny that you do EXACTLY what you accuse me of and insult me without adding to the discussion.

I didn't insult you at all until you tried to do the same to me.  In addition, I am adding to the discussion, far more so than you are.

&gt; And as one redditor out of 170,000 on this sub, your opinion is but the smallest fart in a grand hurricane.

The anti-gun lobby is always looking for new angles they can use to scare voters into supporting bad gun legislation. I don't doubt for a second that they love every photo, video, or post from a drug user, felon, or a group who is drunk/heavily intoxicated who happens to own or have access to guns captured in that media. It's easy media work at that point, and its an easy tool to scare voters into pushing for bad legislation.

In the end the biggest tool gun-owners and advocates are going to have in the long term is a strong positive public relations image. It is *much* harder to work against a group in legislation and popular opinion when that group has a strong positive public relations image, and creating a solid barrier between subreddits revolving around gun ownership and illegal activities is a pretty easy way of adding towards that positive image.

I'm sure some people would disagree, but I think that its one of the most important things that the larger gun community needs to strive for constantly, such that the stories about *positive* gun use and events in gun culture are more popular and visible than *negative* events. e.g. /r/offbeat has a post about an ND that killed a kid - top comments are all gun-owners or those knowledgeable of gun culture jumping in to provide context and describe the known 'rules' of operating a firearm. That is good against bad - a tragic incident with the contrast of commenters providing sympathy, but also strong reminders of the importance of firearm safety.

There's nothing to be lost, at least, from creating that distance and ensuring that gun communities have a positive public image.

I find it very telling that American law has changed drastically, yet the wording of the Constitution remains the same.  To ignore that is to be ignorant of the evolution of our nation, from following the rule of law to ignoring the rule of law.

&gt; Plus, if you can't justify the existence of a law (like 2A), it should not exist, which is why many laws and amendments get repealed.

Yes, because ad hominem attacks are the hallmark of an intelligent mind.

&gt; Missed that ""Shall not be infringed"" part huh? Next you'll be saying only militia members can post. Guess what Shirley, nobody has a problem getting a gun.

Huehue. My point is that some people SHOULD have a problem getting one. You are too busy jerking off to the Constitution to understand the fact that there are some people we do not want having guns. It doesn't have to be black and white, we can make exceptions.

&gt; I find it very telling that American law has changed drastically, yet the wording of the Constitution remains the same. To ignore that is to be ignorant of the evolution of our nation, from following the rule of law to ignoring the rule of law.

That's the purpose of the Supreme Court. For a Constituationalist, you sure don't know much about balance of powers. The courts interpret the letter of the law regardless of whether the text changes. It was designed to function that way. 

&gt; Oh really? I see now why /r/guns[1] has a bad reputation among the gun crowd on reddit. Nobody has to justify the right to self defense, regardless of any other ""crimes"" may have been committed.

I didn't say shit about self defense, I said laws on the books. You have to justify having a law or it should be removed. Recently in my town, they got rid of a law which banned alcohol sales on Sunday because it was no longer justified. That's just basic Democracy. Obviously we all have a right to self defense; I am not arguing that.

Typical redditor, doesn't understand that insulting someone is not an *ad hominem* fallacy. Unless you just mean ""insult"", in which case you shouldn't use a Latin term which is typically reserved for a specific logical fallacy. You can insult someone and be intelligent, friendo, and it doesn't have to discredit the arguments of either side of the debate. 

As for my level of intelligence, I'm not really concerned in that department. It's funny that you do EXACTLY what you accuse me of and insult me without adding to the discussion. And as one redditor out of 170,000 on this sub, your opinion is but the smallest fart in a grand hurricane.

&gt; Let's see you come up with a proper rebuttal other than ""I don't give a fuck.""

Restrictions on the 2nd Amendment are necessary in order to keep certain dangerous demographics (as mentioned above) from having access to firearms. I don't think pot users should be included in this, but the fact of the matter is that they are. American law has changed drastically since the signing of the Constitution and to ignore the last 200 years of history is to be ignorant of the necessary evolution of our nation. Plus, if you can't justify the existence of a law (like 2A), it should not exist, which is why many laws and amendments get repealed.

I also don't personally care about some random person's extracurricular activities. Still not why I RES tag people. 

My problem with pot is not a moral one, it's a legality one. *Federally*, weed is still illegal, so any state laws allowing it are irrelevant when it crosses with firearm ownership. Currently, it is against federal law to be a user of marijuana, while at the same time owning firearms. So while owning a firearm is legal, and smoking pot is only a little illegal, mixing the two becomes a felony. That's bad.

So, when it becomes painfully obvious that someone is such a felon, at the *least*, I will RES tag him/her as such. It serves as a reminder of who I'd like to avoid interacting with on this sub. Again, it has nothing to do with personal feelings towards the activity, but rather how I feel it reflects on this community and firearm owners at large. 

We(I refer to the vast majority of firearm owners) work very hard to purport ourselves as law-abiding citizens in an effort to break the stereotypes that anti-gun proponents have. This becomes difficult when some people become very open about basically being felons and owning guns. That's bad. We don't like it. And as such, many of us would like to know who should be ignored, and who should be discouraged from actively posting and commenting. 

As the OP states, this sub and its sister subs have come under fire from both internal and external sources. Openly allowing felons to post and ""belong"" to the community sets a bad example, it hinders our collective cause, and it gives the opposition ammunition to use against us.

When I read your original post I was so worried for you as it's such a tough surgery, not just physically but mentally too.

I'm genuinely delighted that it went so well and you definitely picked an amazing Doctor to do this for you.

I truly hope that your recovery goes according to plan and that you get the result you're hoping for! I'm sure it's been drilled into you already but... ""dilation, dilation, dilation!!"" hehe xx

The more you do it, the better things will be when you're all done. It's going to hurt sometimes, especially to begin with, but it's worth it in the end. 

Don't forget to just enjoy your new vagina though. Due to the nature of your surgery your gorgeous new vagina is going to feel very ""clinical"" for a while and everything will be about how you're doing medically until it's 100% healed. Don't let that overshadow how you feel mentally, physically and *sexually* as a woman though! 

You're awesome for sharing this story with us all, I truly hope that everything goes perfectly for you and hopefully you'll give us all updates as things heal and progress!

It will come with time, especially once the pain starts to ease and the dressings all come off.

That doesn't mean they approve of his over all job as president or approve of him as a person, that poll was purely about the a speech. People with a brain still know he is a liar and will say anything he needs to to make people ""like him"" or ""believe him"", he is the most divisive and toxic president we have had and he has the gaul to go up there and ask people for unity and to put aside political agendas, when he is the very person who hyper-polarized our political process, has been trying to damage the credibility of our judicial and intelligence agencies since he has been in office.

39.9% approval rating is hardly ""Even democrats are starting to love Trump""
